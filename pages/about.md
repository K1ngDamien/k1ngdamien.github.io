# About

My name is DamiÃ«n Vermaas and I'm a software engineer turned ethical hacker. I have a bachelor
degree in software engineering and did two minors in the field of offensive security and information
security respectively. The years I've been building op work experience within the field of offensive
security and DevSecOps. 

The blogs posts made mainly focus around cyber security topics like capture
the flag writeups, interesting developments within the offensive security field and research topics
I've taken an interest in, including custom projects! But with a software engineering background it
is almost impossible to not touch DevSecOps topics since I see a lot of room for improvements within 
companies for this topic! I hope you enjoy yourself and find a topic that draws your interest. 

For any questions or concerns, reach out to me on Twitter (or is it X now?) `@__dvermaas__`
